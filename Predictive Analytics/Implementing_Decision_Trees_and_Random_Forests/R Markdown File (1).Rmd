***Problem Statement:***
*This project involves building decision tree and random forest models to answer a number of questions. We will use the Carseats dataset that is part of the ISLR package.*

**Loading Required Libraries**
```{r}

library(ISLR)

library(dplyr)

library(glmnet)

library(caret)

library(rpart)

library(rpart.plot)

library(rattle)
```

```{r}
summary(Carseats)
```

**Selecting required attributes**
```{r}
Carseats_Filtered = Carseats %>% select("Sales", "Price", 
"Advertising","Population","Age","Income","Education")
summary(Carseats_Filtered)
```


**Developing a decision tree regression model to forecast Sales using required attributes.("Price", "Advertising", "Population", "Age", "Income" and "Education").**

```{r}
model_1 = rpart(Sales~.,data=Carseats_Filtered,method = 'anova')
summary(model_1)
```

```{r}
fancyRpartPlot(model_1)
```
*The price attribute is utilized at the root node of the tree for the purpose of splitting.*


**Considering the following input: Sales=15,Price=8.71,Population=120,Advertising=0,Age=71,Income= 110,Education=10.Estimating Sales for this record using the decision tree model**

```{r}

prediction_data = data.frame(Price=8.71,Population=120,Advertising=0,Age=71
,Income= 110, Education= 10)


prediction<- predict(model_1,prediction_data)

prediction

```



*Predicted sales value for this record is 9.58625.*

**Using the caret function to train a random forest (method=’rf’) for the same dataset.**

```{r}

set.seed(123)
model_2 <- train(Sales~.,
               data= Carseats_Filtered,
               method = "rf")

# Print the results
model_2

```

*Best results are obtained when mtry value is set to be 2.*

**Customizing the search grid by checking the model’s performance for mtry values of 2, 3 and 5 using 3 repeats of 5-fold cross validation.**
```{r}

set.seed(123)

#Cross-Validation
control <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv",
                     repeats = 3,
                     number = 5)

#Defining search grid with mtry values of 2,3,5
search_grid <- expand.grid(mtry = c(2, 3, 5))


# Training the model using the search grid and cross-validation
model <- train(Sales~., Carseats_Filtered,method = "rf",tuneGrid = search_grid,trControl = control)
print(model)
```
